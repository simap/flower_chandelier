# flower chandelier

## Instructions

1. Laser cut the tulip pattern. You can scale it as necessary for different sizes or insets.
2. Optionally cut 2 wood discs a bit larger to make a vise while heat-bending the petals. You can use a bolt to keep them together.
3. Heat and bend the petals as desired. Depending on the size of inserts, the angle might need to be adjusted.
4. Measure the holes, and use the tulip mount.scad to 3D model mounts for each petal layer. It can make tops, middles and bottoms which thread together.
5. Cut and wire up some LED strips to fit, the printed mount should keep the LEDs snug against the edge.
6. First counter-wind so that the LED wiring doesn't get wrapped up, then thread each segment together.
